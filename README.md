# Engineering Leadership Operational Models
Effective engineering leadership requires implementing the right practices, but with numerous sources and ideas available, identifying the most valuable ones can be challenging. To address this, I've created a series of operational models that consolidate the best practices from my preferred sources and experiences, offering a concise set of checklists and notes for various tasks in the engineering leadership domain.

These models are designed for personal use, enabling you to quickly reference practical tips and tools to enhance your leadership skills. With this resource at hand, you'll be well-equipped to make informed decisions, optimize processes, and foster a successful, collaborative team environment.
