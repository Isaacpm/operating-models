# Requesting Additional Budget from the Finance Team in a Meeting

### Meeting Preparation

1.  Determine the budget cycle to assess the impact of this request on the remaining months of the current cycle (e.g., July to July, February to February).
2.  Familiarize yourself with the current budget.
3.  Calculate the difference between current spending and the budget.
4. Understand the reasons behind the budget discrepancy and any changes in projections. Identify the factors that led to the initial budget being off and why the revised projections are more reliable.
5. Arrange your presentation in a logical sequence, starting with key figures and moving on to the reasons behind the request, alternative scenarios, and the cost estimation process. Be ready to provide additional details on budget consumption and contracts if needed.
6. Develop clear and concise slides or visuals to support your presentation. Use graphs, charts, and tables to illustrate the budget figures, projections, and scenarios. Visual aids can help make complex information more accessible and engaging.

### Meeting Presentation

1.  Begin by presenting key figures to the finance team:
    1.  Original budget
    2.  Updated projections
    3.  Additional amount requested
2.  Clarify the reasons behind the initial budget discrepancy and why the current projections are more accurate.
3.  Discuss the level of confidence in the request, providing alternative scenarios:
    1.  For example, outline the outcomes if an extra 15k is spent or if 15k less is spent.
4. Clearly describe the methodology used to estimate the costs associated with the additional budget request. This will show the finance team that your request is well-reasoned and data-driven, building trust with them.
6.  Highlight any ongoing work or initiatives aimed at meeting the revised forecasts.
